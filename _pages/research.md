[<font size="5">Transport Infrastructure Improvements and Spatial Sorting: Evidence from Buenos Aires</font> ](/files/warnes_pablo_jmp.pdf)

Awarded a research grant from the CAF - Development Bank of Latin America.

*How do improvements in the urban transport infrastructure affect the spatial sorting of
 residents with different levels of income and education within a city? What are the welfare
 effects of improving urban transit once we take into account these patterns of spatial sorting?
 In this paper, I study the effects of the construction of a bus rapid transit system (BRT) on
 the spatial reorganization of residents within the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. To do so,
 I leverage an individual level panel data set of more than two million residents with which
 I can describe intra-city migration patterns. I first find reduced form evidence that the
 construction of the BRT increased the spatial segregation between high and low-skilled residents
 within the city. I then develop a dynamic quantitative spatial equilibrium model of a city with
 heterogeneous workers that allows me to quantify the welfare effects of this BRT system while
 taking into account these spatial sorting patterns. With this quantitative framework, I can measure
 the average welfare gains for residents that were living near the BRT lines before these were built.
 I find that welfare gains were very similar between high- and low-skilled workers living in the same
 locations, but very different within skill levels across locations. Residents living near a BRT line
 in neighborhoods with the lowest share of high-skilled residents saw welfare gains close to 1% on average,
 while residents living near a BRT line in neighborhoods with the highest high-skilled share saw welfare
 gains around 0.5% on average.*
