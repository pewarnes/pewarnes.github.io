Welcome!
I am an economist with research interests in Urban Economics, International Trade, Development Economics, and Applied Microeconomics in general.

I recently completed my PhD in Economics at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/).

In Fall 2021, I will be joining [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) as Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics.

You can find my job market paper, as well as my other research [here](/research).
